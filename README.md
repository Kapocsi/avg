# AVG

A quick way to get the average of files or your clipboard. I mainly built this as an exercise to learn RUST and is a rewrite of a version written in python.


## Usage

I recommend building and then aliasing the executable so that it can be used from any point in the sys.tem

### Get the average of values in your clipboard
`avg -c`

### Get the average of numerics in a file
`avg <file>`

### Print Help Text
`avg <-h/--help>`
